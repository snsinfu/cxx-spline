# Spline demos

## 1D

Run `series1D` which outputs `1Dspline.dat` of the interpolated data.
It also shows that it's possible to do prediction into the future
by adding values of t which are greater than the upper bound of t. 

Plot the data with `plot1Dspline.py`.

## 2D

Run `series2D` which approximates two independent coordinates.
